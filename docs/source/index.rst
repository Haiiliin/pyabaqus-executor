job, extract the output data, and draw figures of the output data.
The Github repository locates in

There are three main parts: menu bar, tool bar, and main working area. All actions available in the menu bar, several most frequently used actions are showed in the tool bar. The working area is the place to make the magic which will be showed later.


Create, Open, Save Project Files
--------------------------

The first thing is to create a new project file, you can click **File -> New** button in the menu bar of **New** button in the tool bar or use the short cut **Ctrl + N** to create a new project file. The project file of Abaqus Executor is a plain text file with the extension of **.abqjson**, it is a **JSON**-format file stores the configuration of the project. 

You can also directly write the project file according the following format and save it as a **.abqjson** file:

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: ABQJSON File Format

    {
        "modelScript": "model-script-file-path",
        "input": "input-file-path",
        "user": "user-subroutine-file-path",
        "odb": "abaqus-odb-file-path",
        "outputScript": "output-script-file-path",
        "data": "data-file-path",
        "x": "x-axis-for-plotting",
        "ys": [
            "y-axis-for-plotting"
        ],
        "xlabel": "x-label",
        "ylabel": "y-label",
        "title": "title"
    }

When you finished the job, please don't forget to click the **File -> Save** or **File -> Save As** button in the menu
bar or **Save** or **Save As** button in the tool bar or use the short cut **Ctrl + S** or **Ctrl + Shift + S** to save
the file before you close the application.

When you have created a project file, you can click the **File -> Open** button in the menu bar or **Open** button in
the tool bar or use the short cut **Ctrl + O** to open the project.

You can also set the default opening application for **.abqjson** file to Abaqus Executor. After that you can
double-click the project file to open it in Abaqus Executor. The executable file path of Abaqus Executor is something
like this:

.. code-block::

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Abaqus Executor\executor.exe


Configure The Project
---------------------

When you have opened a project file, it would be like this:

.. image:: _images/project.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

First, you choose the files to be processed, like the Python script to create the model, the input file, the user
subroutine file, etc. Then, click actions in **Run** in the menu bar or in the tool bar, corresponding action will be
submitted. Each action corresponds to each section in the project settings.

The **Model**, **Submit**, and **Output** actions will use the Abaqus command to call the Abaqus kernel. The following
commands are used:

.. code-block:: shell
    :caption: Abaqus Commands

    cd work-directory
    abaqus cae noGUI script.py
    abaqus job=job-name input=input-name user=user-name int double
    abaqus database=odb-name script=output-script.py


Plot The Figures
--------------------

The **Plot** action is used to plot figures. The following Python code is used to plot the figure

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Python Code To Plot The Figure

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pandas as pd

    fig = plt.figure()

    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    df = pd.read_csv('data-file-path.csv')
    lines = 0
    x, ys = 'x', ['y']
    for y in ys:
        if y not in df.columns:
            continue
        lines += 1
        ax.plot(df[x], df[y], label=y)
    if lines > 0:
        ax.legend()
    ax.set_xlabel('xlabel')
    ax.set_ylabel('ylabel')
    ax.set_title('title')
    ax.grid()
    fig.tight_layout()

You can customize the figure by edit the Code in the **Code** tab and click the **Update** button (|update|, the second
button of the three buttons on the right). You can also click the **Restore** button (|restore|, the third button of
the three buttons on the right) to set it to the default style.

Or, you can also customize the figure using the **matplotlib** default tool button |options| to customize the figure.
